#summary mod_actionscript (fcgi for now) setup for Eclipse CDT

= Setup mod_actionscript in Eclipse CDT =

First, follow EclipseTamarinSetup instructions.

Then:

 * apt-get install zlib1g-dev
 * apt-get install libapache2-mod-fcgid
 * apt-get install libfcgi-dev
 * apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev
 * Get mysqlwrapped: this one will be removed in future. Compile and install in a system accessible location (unlike the defaults). I'll be back with either an alternate solution or details on how to use this library


copy fcgishell directory inside tamarin-central, under your project

edit tamarin-central/manifest.mk:
change line:
`$(call RECURSE_DIRS,shell)`
to:
`$(call RECURSE_DIRS,fcgishell)`

Build the project (click the hammer icon in CDT toolbar or press Ctrl+B - this runs make in your obj directory)

the executable is obj-debug/fcgishell/fcgishell
