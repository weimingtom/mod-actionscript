#summary mod_actionscript (fcgi for now) setup for Eclipse CDT
#labels Deprecated

= Setup mod_actionscript in Eclipse CDT =

First, follow EclipseTamarinSetup instructions.

Then:

 * apt-get install zlib1g-dev
 * apt-get install libapache2-mod-fcgid
 * apt-get install libfcgi-dev
 * apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev



copy fcgishell directory inside tamarin-central, under your project

edit tamarin-central/manifest.mk:
change line:
`$(call RECURSE_DIRS,shell)`
to:
`$(call RECURSE_DIRS,fcgishell)`

Build the project (click the hammer icon in CDT toolbar or press Ctrl+B - this runs make in your obj directory)

the executable is `obj-debug/fcgishell/fcgishell`



Whenever you change something in your `shell_toplevel.as`, and accordingly, in your c++ native classes, run shell_toplevel.py. This will generate the needed c++ link code (shell_toplevel.h and shell_toplevel.cpp) and also the .abc native libraries thet the compiler uses. You need to have asc.jar in tamarin-central/utils for this.
