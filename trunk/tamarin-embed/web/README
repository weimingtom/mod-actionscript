Manual instalation only, for now

This is only tested on Linux Ubuntu 8.10 and Debian 4.x

1. You need to install some packages:

apt-get install libapache2-mod-fcgid
apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev

(restart apache)


Place tamarinfcgi somewhere (eg /home/youruser/bin/)
Add this rule in your apache virtual host

	<Location /actionscript>
	    AddHandler fcgid-script .abc
	    FCGIWrapper /home/youruser/bin/tamarinfcgi .abc
	    Options +ExecCGI
	</Location>

Replace location (/actionscript) with the web directory where you want to host the .abc files.
Copy the example helo.abc in that directory and point your browser to helo.abc file to see it in action.


----------------------------------------------------------
To make changes in the page, you need to recompile helo.as

cd actionscript/source
./compile.sh helo.as

this will overwrite helo.abc in the parent directory
